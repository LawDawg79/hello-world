I am 38 years old, a former Police Officer injured in the line of duty. My career was ended by my injury, back in 2004ish era I and some friends started a web design/hosting business. I built some basic informational business websites with basic code, things like a Fence Company. We had one large project for a vehicle reposession company in which we created an entire database and user interface in which multiple reposession companies and lenders could interact with updates and new repo orders issued by location. But we never generated much more than that, and as people got better paying jobs in other tech fields the business just kinda went away. One partner who hosted the websites continued to do so until customers left or had other developers update their sites. So its been about 12-13 years since I have written code, what was advanced then is basic stuff now. But my back is injured and I am unemployed, fortunately my wife makes decent money and we dont yet have kids. So I have an opportunity here to kinda be like a teenager living at home and play on the computer as much as I want, by play I mean re-learn web design/code because I cant do manual labor and I cant sit up in a computer chair for long periods of time. I have a recliner as a computer chair now that I sit in as I type this. So basically, Im here to learn, I may be old but ive been playing with computers since my Commodore 64.
